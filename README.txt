INTRODUCTION

This code allows to model the nearest neighbour distribution of nanostructures on a substrate using a Monte Carlo approach. The assumption here is that during the growth, the nanostructures have a certain propability to nucleate at a particular position on the substrate which depends on the distance to already existing nanostructures.

This code is part of the following publication, which contains more inforamtion about the physical background:
